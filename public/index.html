<h1>The Best Movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of the most best sci-fi and mind boggling movies of all time.</p>

<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>Full contrast to the previous one, this movie is based on older times of kings and all. It has one of the best stories I've ever seen.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>This movie has the best action I've ever seen in my entire life. Beautiful action scenes and amazing story.</p>
